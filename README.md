## Motivation and Background

Like, I think, a lot of folks, I started trading on the stock market pretty regularly and actively once Covid hit. At the time, I was trading through TD Ameritrade and I was feeling very limited by the interface they provided. Some information I thought was presented well and other information that I found myself referring to often was buried behind 2 or more page loads, leading to lots of wading through different windows to get the information I needed. I happened upon their API and thought that surely there could be a better way to organize myself and display the information I needed and so I started building this app.

Fast forward to 2023 and Schwab was wrapping up their acquisition of TD Ameritrade and migrating API users to their version of the API. The only problem was that they hadn't made their API publicly available yet, so I started looking for alternatives and happened upon Tradier, which seemed to tick a lot of needed boxes and now I was developing with two different brokerages' APIs.
